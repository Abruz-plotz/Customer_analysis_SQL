# SQL Project :- Customer Analysis Project(using SQL)

## A) Inroduction :- 
This project focuses on E-Commerce Customer Churn Analysis to understand customer behavior and identify key factors influencing churn. Using SQL, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed to uncover insights into customer preferences, purchase patterns, and retention strategies. The analysis helps businesses improve customer engagement, reduce churn rates, and enhance overall satisfaction.

## B) Dataset
The dataset contains 5630 rows and 20 columns.The MySQL Workbench shows only 1000 rows.

```sql
select * from customer_churn;
```
#### Output

### C) Data Cleaning:

###### C1) Handling missing values 🟢🟢

```sql
set sql_safe_updates = 0;

update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(WarehouseToHome),0) as avg_WarehouseToHome from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.WarehouseToHome = a.avg_WarehouseToHome
where customer_churn.WarehouseToHome is null;

update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(HourSpendOnApp),0) as avg_HourSpendOnApp  from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.HourSpendOnApp = a.avg_HourSpendOnApp
where customer_churn.HourSpendOnApp is null;
    
update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear),0) as avg_OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear=a.avg_OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear
where customer_churn.OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear is null;
    
update customer_churn
join (select round(avg(DaySinceLastOrder),0) as avg_DaySinceLastOrder from customer_churn)
a on 1=1 set customer_churn.DaySinceLastOrder=a.avg_DaySinceLastOrder
where customer_churn.DaySinceLastOrder is null;
    
update customer_churn
set Tenure = (select Tenure from
(select Tenure,count(Tenure) as value_occurrence from customer_churn group by
Tenure order by value_occurrence desc limit 1) as mode_Tenure)
where Tenure is null;   
    
update customer_churn
set CouponUsed = (select CouponUsed from
(select CouponUsed,count(CouponUsed) as value_occurrence from customer_churn group by
CouponUsed order by value_occurrence desc limit 1) as mode_CouponUsed)
where CouponUsed is null;   
     
update customer_churn
set OrderCount = (select OrderCount from
(select  OrderCount,count(OrderCount) AS value_occurrence from customer_churn group by
OrderCount order by value_occurrence desc limit 1) as mode_OrderCount)
where OrderCount is null;
```
*****Remarks:- The null values in numerical columns like WarehouseToHome, HourSpendOnApp, OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear, DaySinceLastOrder are imputed using average
and the null values in categorical columns like Tenure,CouponUsed,OrderCount are imputed using mode.*****



###### C2) Handling outliners 🟢🟢

```sql
Select * from customer_churn where WarehouseToHome > 100;
delete from customer_churn where WarehouseToHome > 100;
```
#### Output
![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abruz-plotz/Customer_analysis_SQL/main/Scrnshts/Dist_100_todelete.png)

*****Remarks:- There are 2 outliners present.After deleting both rows the resulting dataset has dimension 5,628 X 20.*****



### D) Dealing with Inconsistencies

```sql   
   update customer_churn 
   set PreferredPaymentMode = case
   when PreferredPaymentMode = 'cc' then 'Credit Card'
   when PreferredPaymentMode = 'cod' then 'Cash on Delivery'
   else PreferredPaymentMode
   end,
   PreferredLoginDevice = case
   when PreferredLoginDevice = 'Phone' then 'Mobile Phone'
   else PreferredLoginDevice
   end,
   PreferedOrderCat = case 
   when PreferedOrderCat = 'Mobile' then 'Mobile Phone'
   else PreferedOrderCat 
   end;
   
Select * from customer_churn;
```
#### Output
![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abruz-plotz/Customer_analysis_SQL/main/Scrnshts/Mobile_Phone.png)

*****Remarks:- The Mobile/Phone in Preferred Login Device column is standardized as Mobile Phone,'cc' and 'cod' in PreferredPaymentMode 
is Normalized as 'Credit Card' and 'Cash On Delivery' respectively.*****



### E) Data Transformation: 
###### E1) Column Renaming and Creating New Columns 🟢🟢

```sql 
alter table customer_churn
rename column PreferedOrderCat to PreferredOrderCat,
rename column HourSpendOnApp to HoursSpentOnApp,
add column ComplaintReceived varchar(50),
add column ChurnStatus varchar(50);

update customer_churn 
set ComplaintReceived  = case
when Complain = 1 then 'Yes'
else 'No'
end,
ChurnStatus = case
when churn = 1 then 'Churned'
else 'Active'
end;
```
*****Remarks:- The column names of 2 columns are corrected and updated the columns 'ComplaintReceived' and 'ChurnStatus' to display descriptive text (“Yes”/“No”, “Churned”/“Active”) instead of numeric indicators (1/0).*****

 

###### E2) Column Dropping 🟢🟢

```sql
alter table customer_churn
drop column churn,
drop column complain;

select * from customer_churn;
```
